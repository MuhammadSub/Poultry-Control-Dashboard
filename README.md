# Poultry-Control-Dashboard

The Poultry Control Dashboard is a web-based application that provides a graphical representation of temperature and humidity data in a poultry farm. The application allows users to monitor and analyze the environmental conditions of their poultry houses, enabling better control and management of the poultry production process.

The dashboard utilizes data collected from various sensors installed in different locations within the poultry farm. These sensors continuously measure temperature and humidity levels and transmit the data to the backend of the application. The application then processes and presents this data in the form of interactive graphs and charts.

With the Poultry Control Dashboard, users can easily visualize the temperature and humidity trends over time. The graphs display real-time data as well as historical data, allowing users to analyze patterns and make informed decisions regarding the poultry environment.

To connect the backend of the dashboard to the frontend, the application utilizes the XAMPP server. XAMPP provides an easy-to-use platform for hosting the application and managing the database. It ensures a smooth and secure communication between the backend and the frontend, enabling seamless data retrieval and display.

The dashboard supports multiple user accounts, allowing each user to have a personalized view of their poultry houses' temperature and humidity data. Users can access the dashboard through their web browsers and navigate through different poultry houses to view specific temperature and humidity information.

Overall, the Poultry Control Dashboard enhances poultry farm management by providing a comprehensive overview of temperature and humidity conditions. It empowers users to take proactive measures to optimize the poultry environment and ensure the well-being and productivity of their flocks.
